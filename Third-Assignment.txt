1) Given an array of N elements and the task is to print the elements of an array after left rotating array elements by p positions.

Input: Read array elements and read no.of positions (p) to rotate.

Output: Array elements after positions rotation.

Example:

    Input:
    array elements: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
	Positions : 3

    Output: 
    4 5 6 7 1 2 3
	
	
	
2) Given an array of N elements and the task is to print the elements of an array after right rotating array elements by p positions.

Input: Read array elements and read no.of positions (p) to rotate.

Output: Array elements after positions rotation.

	
	Input:
    	array elements: 1 2 3 4 5 
	position = 2
    

    Output: 
    4 5 1 2 3
	
3) You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array. Traverse array only once.

Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] 
Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 
	
	
4) You are given an array of 0s,  1s and 2s in random order. Segregate 0s, 1s and 2s in the array.

Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0] 
Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2] 


5) Write a Java program to find the Leader element from an given array of integers. 
   
Leader element: A Leader element is an element that appears more than n/2 times where n is the size of the array.

Note: 

If more than one leader element is presented then print highest number from those.
If no Leader element present in the given array then print "Leader Element Doesn't Exist".

Input : { 1, 6, 6, 5, 7, 4, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2 };

Output : 7


6) Write a java program to find super elements in given integer array. If no super element is presented then print output as "No Super Elements".

Super Element : The element which contains at least two greater elements is called Super Element.

Ex : 1, 5, 3, 6

Output : 1 and 3 are super elements 

Explanation : 

1 : 1 is having 3,5,6 as greater elements so it is super element

5 : 5 is having only 6 as greater so it is not super element 

3 : 3 is having 5 and 6 as greater so it is super element 

6 : 6 doesn't have any greater element so it is not super element.
